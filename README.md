# LWJGL2-ThinMatrix-Tutorial-Notes

This repository is all the notes I took after watching ThinMatrix' LWJGL2 Java tutorials. 
It is made up of a pdf of my rough paper notes along with an intellij Idea workspace.

I take no credit for the code in the workspace.
I do take credit for the large amounts of comments in the code however.

Please excuse how disorganized my paper notes are, they are simply rough notes taken as I watched ThinMatrix' tutorials.
Also the name of the project may change in different branches. Don't pay any mind.

This is a link to the tutorial series:
